Data Science Internship Tasks for CodSoft
# 📈 Sales Prediction Using Python - CODSOFT Internship Task 4

## 📌 Objective
To build a machine learning regression model that predicts product sales based on advertising expenditure across different media channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper).

## 📁 Dataset
- **File**: `advertising.csv` (provided by CODSOFT)
- **Features**:
  - `TV`: Advertising budget on TV (in ₹)
  - `Radio`: Advertising budget on Radio (in ₹)
  - `Newspaper`: Advertising budget on Newspapers (in ₹)
- **Target**:
  - `Sales`: Product sales (in ₹)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression, train_test_split, r2_score, mean_squared_error)

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Uploaded and loaded the `advertising.csv` dataset
2. Explored and visualized the data
3. Split data into features (X) and target (y)
4. Trained a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - R² Score
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
6. Plotted Actual vs Predicted sales for visual validation

## 📊 Results
- **R² Score**: ~`[insert your score]` (e.g., 0.8972)
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: ~`[insert your MSE]` (e.g., 2.84)
